## Usage

### Image insertion

The programm can insert images onto the Template. All images that are imported have to be given horizontal aligned, since the programm automaticly flips the spine and backcover. While the programm tries to fit the background color of the insert, by finding the edge color of the cover image

### Dimensions

The program automaticly makes the images fit to the smallest dimension of the section. As Example: If a cover with a higher resulution than the template is, is inserted the program automaticly scales the image down to fit the width of the cover without changing its proportions.
